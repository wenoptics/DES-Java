# Java Implementation of DES

---

[INFSCI 2591] Algorithm Design

### TODOs:

 - [x] The encryption process
 - [x] IP and $$ IP^{-1} $$ 
 - [x] |--Implementations of complete `f` function in DES
 - [x] |----- `SBOX` implementation
 - [x] |--The key schedule 
 - [x] |----- `LS`s
 - [x] The decrypting process
 - [ ] Demo program entry and test plaintext/ciphertext
